in 1964 linux - started -> Bell Laboratory,New Jersey -> to build operating system for multi user. 5 people
In 1969 the project was widrawn.

but Dennis ritchie( c language) and ken thompson still worked and made > UNICS (Uniplexed Information and Computing Services)>free

in 1975 > UNIX v6 > became popular.
* Now multiple companies made their own commercial version.

unics versions >

 IBM   > AIX
 Sun   > Solaris
 apple > Mac OS
 HP    > UX

 > These above are called flavour of UNIX.

 Then Linux was creatd as flavour of unics.

 Linus Torvald (1991) > student at hashing university > wanted free unics version.

 Linus Torvald wrote Linux from scratch. (Inspired by unics os and MINIX (created by Andrew Tanenbaun for teaching students))

 * Andrew Tanenbaun was a professor(computer networks pearson publication )

Around 1991 and 1995 a free software movement was started. bcus company giants like IBM and apple provided high paid softwares and people were not 
able to learn. > Free Software movement was started (GNU was the name of the movement.)

GNU Members provided many free softwares.

Linux is a kernel not an operating system.
An operating system  = kernel + Softwares. (linux + GNU is an OS) > but us usually reffered as LINUX

** kernel is a part of an OS.


## Linux was provided as open source OS and multiple companies made their own versions.

Linux > RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) > one of the most popular. > Red Hat is a company (provides free os but paid services)
Linux > Fedora (Fedora is a group that provides fedora OS) (provides free os but paid services)
Linux > Debian (provides free os but paid services)
Linux > free Ubuntu, CentOS, Amazon Linux (these are completely free)
Linux > kali linux (mostly used by hackers)

** Enetrprise versions are paid.

* CentOS is teh fastest (Community Enterprise Operating System)
* Ubuntu is 3rd most popular linux distribution (Ubunt means team work >made by an African)

** Os is operated by CLI and GUI
* GUI is popular in windows
* CLI is used by linux.

** Different linux versions are called linux distribution
* Distribution is aka OS



** Advantages of LINUX os

-> Linux is not a UNIX derivative. 
-> Linux is secure compared to windows.
 * Bcus usually when virus enters a windows folder it starts dpreading in the entire system. >uses antivirus
   But when it enters a linux folder it remains there. > does not need antivirus > just delete the folder.
->Simplified updates of all installed softwares.
->Light weight (Size(aka foot print) of os is less and ram consumption is less ) (1gb ram equivalent to 50gb RAm for windows)

-> Multi User - Multi task > 1 linux sercver can be access by multiple users and have shared cpu and hardware
-> Linux supporst multiple users
-> But in windows same thing can happen but limited users 
->Unlike WIndows linux has multiple distributions > Red Hat,Debian, Fedora.



Layered architecture of Windows and Linux 

Windows :

1st innner most layer is the :
> hardware
> Operating System (os interacts with the hardware and provides request made by shell and manages hardware)
> Shell (Shell interacts with user, accepts requests from user and sends to the OS) 
>User > provides command or requests

* Most used terms
>folder(aka directory in linux)
>Administrator(aka root user in linux)
>Software(aka package)

Linux : 


1st innner most layer is the :
> hardware
> Kernel(here acting as OS) ( interacts with the hardware and provides request made by shell and manages hardware)
> Shell (Shell interacts with user, accepts requests from user and sends to the OS) 
>User > provides command or requests
** Most used terms
> Directory
>Root user (aka administrator)
>package (aka software in windows.)

** Advatanges over windows

In Linuc CLI is used for performing operations and compared to GUI which adds extra operations of mouse movements > clicks > Accessing request >
   Creating command for request and then sending to shell .




                                FIle system hierarchy 

Windows :

in windows -> C:\ (backward slash ,root directory , created by default) > contains all the configuration files of windows.
           > Program files,users,Prograam(x86),Perflogs

Linux :
4es5dtd6te5ers5tgd
in linux -> / (forward slash, is the top level root directory) 
           > /root,/home,/boot,/etc,/usr,/bin


/       - The main (root) directory of Linux  
/bin    - Basic commands like copy (cp), move (mv), and list (ls)  ,Essential binaries (commands taht can be used by all users) 
/sbin   - Special commands for system management ,(System binaries (admin commands only used by admins)) 
/boot   - Files needed to start (boot) the system ,(kernel, bootloader) 
/dev    - Special files for hardware like hard drives and USBs  
/etc    - Settings and configuration files for the system  (System configuration files ),like 4gb RAM, 1TB harddisk etc
/home   - Personal folders for users (User home directories  ) 
/lib    - Important files that help programs run  (Shared libraries for system binaries)
/media  - 'p_?>KWhere USB drives and CDs are accessed  (Mount point for external media (USB, CD))
/mnt    - Temporary place to attach (mount) extra storage (Temporary mount point for filesystems )  
/opt    - Extra software installed manually  ( Optional software packages  ) like google chrome.
/proc   - Information about running programs and the system ,(Virtual filesystem for system info) 
/root   - Personal folder for the system administrator (root user) (Root userâ€™s home directory,also if no users are created root is default )  
/run    - Temporary files needed while the system is running ,(Temporary runtime files)   
/srv    - Data used by services like web servers ,( Data for system services (e.g., web, FTP)) 
/sys    - Details about the system and hardware,(System and hardware info )  
/tmp    - Temporary files that are deleted on restart ,(Temporary files (cleared on reboot) ) 
/usr    - Programs and files for users (e.g., applications),(User applications and utilities )  are by default installed here.
/var    - Frequently changing data like logs and emails ,(Variable data (logs, cache, mail)) 


Boot process -> After a pc is switched on > all inactive files,packages are activated also POST (Power on self test is done like  battery is charged or not)


linux and unix designed for different purposes and audience

* constantly updated by large community of developers which means faster updates and bug fixes.


proprietery , not open source , need a license to use it.
updates tends to be slower

unix is more specialized and tailored to more specialized tasks.
provides stability and 

linux kernel :  process management , file system management,running multiple [rograms at once.

hardware abstraction : software does not need to be avare of the hardware,it 
 just communictaes with the kernel which makes it efficient

Modularity : can add extra features like : deivce drivers , network protocols , 
             customizable for personal use and powering servers.

shell and bash :

shell : a command line interface that lets you interactwith the operating system
bridge between u and kernel, take command , interprets it and communicates to the hardware.
jobs : scripting,command history , Job control

popular shells in linux : Bash,Zsh,Fish


Bash : improved version of Bourne shell (sh)

Better scripting tools,
command line editing,
support for arrays and functions

shell is general term for any CLI.
But bash is specific type of shell with advanced features 


Basic components of Linux :

Kernel : memory managemt,Process schesuling,device communication

system libraries : these provide functions that allow applications to directly interact with the kernel.


system utility : specialized programs handling 



TCP/ip/networking/Architecture/specific apllications and services


* kernel version of the system u are on  .

uname : prints about system information.
uname -a : Linux rahul-HP-Laptop-15q-ds0xxx 6.8.0-38-generic #38-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Jun  7 15:25:01 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

uname variations :

uname - v (version)
uname -r (release)


Part | Meaning
Linux | The kernel name (you're using the Linux kernel).
rahul-HP-Laptop-15q-ds0xxx | The hostname of your machine (typically shows username-device model).
6.8.0-38-generic | The kernel version: 6.8.0 is the version, -38-generic is the specific build variant from Ubuntu.
#38-Ubuntu | The build number and distro: This is the 38th build of this kernel, built for Ubuntu.
SMP | Symmetric Multi-Processing support, meaning the kernel can handle multiple CPU cores.
PREEMPT_DYNAMIC | Kernel preemption model: allows dynamic switching between preemptive and non-preemptive modes for better responsiveness.
Fri Jun  7 15:25:01 UTC 2024 | The date and time the kernel was compiled.
x86_64 | The machine hardware name: 64-bit architecture.
x86_64 | The processor type (same as above).
x86_64 | The hardware platform (again, 64-bit).
GNU/Linux | The operating system: GNU tools + Linux kernel = GNU/Linux.  


current ip address : 

ifconfig (interface configuration)  (old way)

shows loopback device and ethernet device,ipv4 address,ipv6 address,subnet mask :

Linux rahul-HP-Laptop-15q-ds0xxx 6.8.0-38-generic #38-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Jun  7 15:25:01 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux


** ip addr show : gives me every thing
* ip addr show eth0


? how would you check disk space :

df -ah   (disk free all file systems ,human readable formatting)

? how to manage a service

** service app-name status (oldway)
** service mysql status


** systemctl status mysql

? space used by content of a directory :

* du -sh "Linux Notes" (path)
   or go in dir > du -sh

// Networking 

? check for open ports , listening network sockets, services that are listenig to TCP/UDP port or sockets

** netstat : gives a long list.

basically hace to filter down : netstat -tulpn (show tcp connections, show udp connections, only listening , show numerical addresses instead of numerical names )
* netstat -tulpn | grep mysql 

ss â€“ Socket Stat (Modern Replacement for netstat)

ss provides more detailed information about socket connections and is faster than netstat.

Example: Find PID by Port Number
ss -tuln | grep :8080
This shows TCP/UDP connections listening on port 8080, and it will include the PID in the output.

? how to check cpu usage of a process

top/htop/ ps aux | grep process-name

ps â€“ Show napshot of Running Processes
âœ… Basic usage:

ps

Shows processes running in the current terminal.

âœ… Full system processes:

ps aux

âœ… Filter by process name:

ps aux | grep apach

4. kill â€“ Terminate a Process by PID
âœ… Example:

kill 1234
Stops the process with PID 1234.

ðŸ”´ Force kill:

kill -9 1234

ðŸ”« 5. pkill â€“ Kill by Process Name

âœ… Example:

pkill firefox
Kills all processes named firefox.

pidof â€“ Get PID of a Process

pidof nginx


? dealing with mounts :

 ls /mnt

mount /dev/sda2 /mnt

to check existing mounts : simply mount

? how to look for something :

using man command

man command-name 

* man ps
